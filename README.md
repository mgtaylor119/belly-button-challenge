During this challenge, I used JavaScript to parse the data into three different dynamic charts, create a dropdown menu, and a demographic box that would also change with the dropdown selection.

Below is an example of the bar chart, showing the top ten OTU's for the individual selected in the drop down:

Below is an example of the bubble chart, showing each individual's OTU IDs and Sample_Values:

And here is an example of the demographic info box, which will update with the individual's demographic information once selected from the drop down:

I launched all of this to GitHub Pages:
